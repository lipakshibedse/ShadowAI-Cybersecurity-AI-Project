## 📌 About the Project
 ShadowAI is built to assist cybersecurity teams with **smart anomaly detection** using a trained machine-learning model.  
 It analyzes event logs, user behaviors, and system actions to determine whether an activity is:

- ✔ Normal  
- ⚠ Suspicious  
- ❌ Potential Threat  

The system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on simulated cybersecurity logs.

#### ⚙️ Key Features  
✅ Real-time data visualization (AI usage patterns, departments, and activity heatmaps)  
✅ Machine Learning model (Random Forest) for predicting insider threats  
✅ Risk detection alerts (flagging high-risk employees or actions)  
✅ Integrated SQLite database (data stored locally for security)  
✅ Scalable, clean, and modular project structure 
✅ User-friendly Streamlit dashboard
